                        Andrew Bryant can still remember when he thought of climate change as primarily a problem of the
                        future. When he heard or read about troubling impacts, he found himself setting them in 2080, a
                        year that, not so coincidentally, would be a century after his own birth. The changing climate,
                        and all the challenges it would bring, were “scary and sad,” he said recently, “but so far in
                        the future that I’d be safe.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That was back when things were different, in the long-ago world of 2014 or so. The Pacific
                        Northwest, where Bryant is a clinical social worker and psychotherapist treating patients in
                        private practice in Seattle, is a largely affluent place that was once considered a potential
                        refuge from climate disruption. Climate change sometimes came up in therapy sessions in the
                        context of other issues — say, a couple having arguments because they couldn’t decide if it was
                        still ethical to have kids — but it was rare, and usually fairly theoretical. “We’re lucky to be
                        buffered by wealth and location,” Bryant said. “We are lucky to have the opportunity to look
                        away.”

                        The smoke was the first sign that things were starting to change. People who live in the coastal
                        Northwest often joke that the brief, beautiful bluebird summers are the reason everyone puts up
                        with so many months of chilly gloom. But starting in the mid-2010s, those beloved blue skies
                        began to disappear. First, the smoke came in occasional bursts, from wildfires in Canada or
                        California or Siberia, and blew away when the wind changed direction. Within a few summers,
                        though, it was coming in thicker, from more directions at once, and lasting longer. The sun
                        turned blood-red or was all but blotted out, disappearing along with the city skyline; the sky
                        turned gray, or sepia, or eerily tangerine, and ash floated down like snow. Sometimes there were
                        weeks when you were advised not to open your windows or exercise outside. Sometimes there were
                        long stretches where you weren’t supposed to breathe the outside air at all.
